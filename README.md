# UART Transceiver implementation for FPGA

This is a project done for the EN2111 Electronic Circuit Design module in the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa.

A UART communication link was implemented between two FPGA boards, and it was tested by giving binary numbers as inputs and displaying them on a 7-segment display in the receiver FPGA board.
